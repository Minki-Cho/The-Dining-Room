- Awards, recognitions, important reviews, notable reception
Reviews : 
A : You all worked so hard to develop it! It's a Tycoon-like game, so I enjoyed playing it. The characters were cute and pretty, and the game elements were very fun.
B : At the end of the day, even if I gave food to the customers I received, I couldn't get money for the rest of the time, so I purposely played without receiving customers. Maybe that's why I didn't feel like I was using up all my time. Except for this, I enjoyed it.
C : I had a lot of fun. I thought it was a perfect game for killing time thanks to the guests' unique attire and not too complicated manipulation. I hope you can quit your part-time job and become a CEO.
D :I hope the ingredients become more diverse and there will be more days to play! And if the game expands, I think it would be nice to have an item that can speed up! I hope the day gets a little longer! And I like the background music!
